### a) Factors to Consider When Selecting a Technology Stack for Backend Development

1. **Scalability**:
   - **Spring Boot**: Known for robustness and scalability, often used for large-scale applications. It supports complex, high-performance architectures.
   - **Node.js**: Excellent for handling concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications and microservices.

2. **Performance**:
   - **Spring Boot**: High performance in multi-threaded environments. Javaâ€™s JVM optimizations enhance its execution speed.
   - **Node.js**: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allows it to handle many connections simultaneously, but might face performance issues in CPU-intensive operations.

3. **Development Speed and Ease**:
   - **Spring Boot**: Requires understanding of Java and Spring ecosystem. It has a steeper learning curve but offers comprehensive tools and libraries.
   - **Node.js**: JavaScript environment, making it easier for full-stack developers familiar with JavaScript. Rapid development with extensive libraries and frameworks (e.g., Express.js).

4. **Community and Ecosystem**:
   - **Spring Boot**: Strong community support with extensive documentation, libraries, and enterprise-level tools. Preferred for traditional, large-scale enterprise applications.
   - **Node.js**: Active and growing community with a vast array of open-source libraries (npm). Ideal for startups and modern web applications.

5. **Integration and Ecosystem**:
   - **Spring Boot**: Seamlessly integrates with other Java-based frameworks and tools (e.g., Hibernate, Spring Security). Strong support for enterprise integrations.
   - **Node.js**: Easily integrates with various databases and APIs. Popular for building RESTful APIs and microservices architecture.

6. **Maintenance and Future-proofing**:
   - **Spring Boot**: Mature technology with long-term support and stability. Suitable for applications requiring long-term maintenance and support.
   - **Node.js**: Rapidly evolving, with frequent updates and new features. However, it requires staying updated with the latest changes and trends.

7. **Cost**:
   - **Spring Boot**: Potentially higher initial cost due to the need for experienced Java developers. However, the mature ecosystem can reduce costs in the long run.
   - **Node.js**: Generally lower initial development costs. Abundant availability of JavaScript developers can reduce hiring expenses.

### b) Suitable Technology Stack for the Given Scenario

**Recommendation: Node.js**

**Justification:**

1. **Real-time Features**:
   - The fitness class booking application is likely to require real-time updates (e.g., class availability, booking confirmations). Node.js, with its event-driven architecture, excels in handling real-time applications.

2. **Development Speed**:
   - As a startup, speed to market is crucial. Node.js enables rapid development and iteration cycles, which is essential for startups needing to launch quickly and iteratively improve their product.

3. **JavaScript Proficiency**:
   - The company is already using React for the frontend, which means the development team is proficient in JavaScript. Using Node.js for the backend ensures a unified language stack, reducing the learning curve and improving collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

4. **Scalability**:
   - While Spring Boot is highly scalable, Node.js is also scalable and can handle the expected concurrency for an online booking platform effectively. For a startup, the initial scalability requirements can be adequately met with Node.js.

5. **Community and Resources**:
   - Node.js has a vibrant and supportive community, offering numerous resources, libraries, and tools that can help accelerate development and solve common problems encountered in building web applications.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - The availability of JavaScript developers and the open-source nature of Node.js can lead to reduced development and maintenance costs, which is beneficial for a startup operating with limited resources.

In conclusion, for a startup company building a web application like a fitness class booking system, Node.js is a suitable choice due to its real-time capabilities, development speed, and alignment with the existing JavaScript expertise of the team.
